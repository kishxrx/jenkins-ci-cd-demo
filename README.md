# Building a Robust Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline for a Containerized Node.js Application

This document chronicles the journey of setting up a simple CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js application using Jenkins and Docker. The initial task, as outlined by the internship, was straightforward. However, the path to a successful build was fraught with a wide array of real-world technical challenges, from local environment failures to complex cloud configurations.

This README serves as a "post-mortem" and a log of the immense troubleshooting, debugging, and persistence required to overcome these hurdles. This is Part 1 of the story.

## Objective

The core goal was to set up a basic Jenkins pipeline to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying a containerized application.

- **Tools:** Jenkins, Docker  
- **Deliverable:** A Jenkinsfile to build and deploy an application.

## Phase 1: The Local Environment Nightmare (The "Docker on Windows" Problem)

The journey began with an attempt to set up the environment locally on a Windows 10 machine using Docker Desktop with the WSL 2 backend. This immediately led to a series of critical, blocking errors.

### The Initial Error: WSL Command Timeout

The first sign of trouble was Docker Desktop's complete inability to communicate with its WSL backend. The application would hang and eventually crash, citing:

> A timeout occurred while executing a WSL command.  
> checking WSL version: context deadline exceeded  

This indicated a fundamental breakdown between the Windows host and the Linux subsystem.

### The Troubleshooting Gauntlet

A multi-day effort to resolve this issue involved a cascade of attempted solutions, each revealing a deeper problem:

- **Standard Resets:** The initial advice of `wsl --shutdown` and restarting Docker Desktop proved ineffective.  
- **Forceful Process Killing:** Manually ending all Docker and `vmmem` processes in Task Manager was attempted to release file locks.  
- **Manual File Deletion:** Attempts to delete Docker's data folders (`%APPDATA%\Docker`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Docker`) failed due to a stubborn, unkillable background process that kept files locked, throwing _The process cannot access the file..._ errors.  
- **The "Scorched Earth" Approach:** Only a full system reboot, followed by an immediate manual deletion of the files before Docker could restart, was successful in cleaning the corrupted data.  
- **The C: Drive Revelation:** The first "Aha!" moment came when we discovered the primary C: drive had less than 4GB of free space. This was insufficient for Docker to create its virtual disk (`ext4.vhdx`).  
- **The `.wslconfig` Dead End:** The next attempt was to force WSL to use another drive by creating a `.wslconfig` file. This led to the second, more critical discovery: the `basePath` directive, which is the standard solution for this problem, is not supported on Windows 10. This was the final nail in the coffin for the local environment approach.  

After days of intense effort, it was clear that the local machine's environment was fundamentally incompatible or broken in a way that standard troubleshooting could not resolve.

## Phase 2: The Pivot to a Cloud Environment

With the local machine being a dead end, the strategy shifted to using a cloud-based development environment to bypass the local issues entirely. GitHub Codespaces was chosen for its speed and integration.

This pivot was immediately successful. A new codespace was created, and within minutes, we had a stable Linux environment with a working Docker installation. The problems that had blocked progress for days were solved in under five minutes.

### The New Challenge: Docker-in-Docker

The relief was short-lived, as a new, more complex set of challenges emerged. The goal was to run Jenkins inside a Docker container, which would then be used to build other Docker containersâ€”a classic "Docker-in-Docker" scenario.

- **Initial Setup:** Jenkins was started in a Docker container using a persistent volume (`-v jenkins_home...`) to save its data.  
- **Plugin Configuration:** The Docker Pipeline plugin was correctly identified as a necessary component to allow Jenkins to understand `agent { docker { ... } }` syntax in the Jenkinsfile.  
- **The `docker: not found` Error:** The pipeline repeatedly failed, with the Jenkins container reporting that the `docker` command itself did not exist. This was the central challenge of this phase.  

### The Solution: The Docker Socket

The root cause was that the Jenkins container, for security reasons, is isolated from the main Docker engine running on the Codespace host. The fix was to grant it permission by re-creating the container with a crucial new option:

- `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`: This command "bind-mounts" the host's Docker control socket into the Jenkins container, effectively giving it a direct phone line to the Docker engine.

This step required stopping and removing the old container and starting a new one with the correct command, a process that was repeated multiple times due to persistent and baffling failures.

## A Note on Persistence

This document currently covers the monumental effort required just to get a stable environment and a correctly configured Jenkins server. The struggle was defined by hitting one wall after another, where each solution only revealed a new, deeper problem.

The journey so far has been a testament to the reality of DevOps work: it is often less about writing code and more about the relentless, methodical, and sometimes frustrating process of debugging the complex interactions between tools, operating systems, and environments.
